## UX HeatGrid Chrome Extension

### Overview
**UX HeatGrid** is a browser extension that allows users to visualize content density and layout balance through real-time heatmaps. We are committed to protecting your privacy and follow a user-initiated approach — the extension only runs when you explicitly interact with it.

### Data Collection
We do not collect any personal data.

This extension:
*   **Does NOT** collect personal information
*   **Does NOT** track your browsing history
*   **Does NOT** send any data to external servers
*   **Does NOT** use analytics or tracking tools
*   **Does NOT** run automatically on any page

### Data Processing
The extension processes the content of the active tab locally on your device to generate the heatmap overlay. This data is:
*   Processed in real-time within your browser's memory
*   Never transmitted to any external server
*   Discarded immediately when you close the extension or the tab

### How It Works
*   The extension does not inject any scripts automatically into web pages
*   Scripts are only injected after you click the extension icon or trigger a specific action
*   The extension only accesses the currently active tab after a user gesture
*   No broad host permissions or `<all_urls>` access is requested

### Permissions
The extension requests minimal permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `activeTab` | Access only the current tab, and only after you interact with the extension |
| `scripting` | Dynamically inject the heatmap generation code when you activate it |

### Third-Party Services
This extension does not use any third-party services, APIs, advertisement networks, or analytics.

### Data Sharing
Since we do not collect any data, we have no personal information to share, sell, or trade with any third parties.

### Security
Because UX HeatGrid runs entirely locally on your device and does not transmit data over the internet, your exposure to remote security risks via this extension is non-existent.

### User Control
You have full control over the extension:
*   **On-Demand**: The extension only runs when you ask it to.
*   **Transparency**: You can view the source code to verify these claims.

### Changes to This Policy
If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date above.

### Contact
If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue on our GitHub repository.

### Summary
UX HeatGrid works entirely offline and locally. It only runs when you explicitly use it, and your data never leaves your device.
